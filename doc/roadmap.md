# Roadmap
*failing to plan is planning to fail*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>


## TODO
*what needs to be done, listed in order of priority*

- Collaborate with Michael.T (& dev team) to confirm a workable gui. (Charl)
- We need to make the `ubuntuplanet.dev` repo on GitHub *private* (Michael.T)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>


## Synopsis
The current `ubuntuplanet.org` web-site's front-end (& back-end) needs a serious upgrade:

#### Back-end
HARDWARE: We need a strong (dedicated) server on which to host `ubuntuplanet.org` with parallel-processing (multi-threading) & virtualization capabilities, hosted in a secure data-center. This is not too grand and will not cost too much at all, but is necessary for future development.

SOFTWARE: We need to use what our developers are skilled in.<br>
- LAMP ? .: (Linux Apache MySQL PHP/Python)
- :: any suggestions welcome ::
<br><br>


#### Front-end
HARDWARE: We need to make this site mobile-friendly.

SOFTWARE: This site/apps MUST be compatible with the most popular web browsers & platforms, desktop including; JavaScript detection with graceful-fail is mandatory -- tell the end-user JS is required.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>


## Roles & Responsibilities
Each member of the team has a designated (or assumed) role and is responsible for their part. Roles may change in the future and the same will apply.

#### layout
- Michael.T has to approve a layout that best suit the needs for the ubuntuplanet.org persona.
- Charl.S has to find (or make) some modern web-app-templates/themes and get 1 approved -- as soon as possible.
